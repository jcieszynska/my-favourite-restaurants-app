## Visuals
A lot of effort was put to the visual side of the application. First, it was deisgned in the Adobe XD, which was very hepful, when it comes to designing in Android Studio. A custom font was implemented as well as custom buttons and Edit Texts. Backgrounds, every one of them is different for every activity, were also designed in Adobe XD and implemented in Android Studio.
